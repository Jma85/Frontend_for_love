            box model in CSS is a container that contains various properties, including borders, margins, padding, and the content itself. 
            These properties collectively determine the dimensions and spacing of an element.
            border box is better than content box because it includes padding and border in the width and height of the element.
            a container is reusable and can be used to create a variety of layouts.
            1em is equal to the current font-size of the element ie 1em = 16px = 1.5rem

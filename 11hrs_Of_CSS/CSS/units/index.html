        <h1>CSS Units</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>There are different units in css for expressing length.
            Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
            Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
            they decide the size of everything on the page. most common is px, with default being 16px.
            The percentage is relative for it's parent.Ie 25% if the parent is 50%
            The rem is relative to the font-size of the root (webpage) not the parent.
            Ie 2rem is 32px if the root is 16px
            em is relative to the parent so it does the parent's font-size. it is normally used for others
            like padding, margin incase of the button.
            width is better as % than vw because vw causes a stroll bar at the bottom and that isn't pretty.
            ch is relative to the character width of the "0" (zero) font-size.  Common for magazines.we have a certain with based on the chracter size &helps define columns
